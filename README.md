# A Game in GO - Guess Number

The purpose of this assignment are:
1. Learn yet another programming language
2. Practice your creativity
3. Apply the concepts of  Data Types

## Description of your Game
Let's see how luck you are guessing a random number! Set the range of number for your to guess a (guaranteed) random number. 

## How to run
It's simple!
* Install GO, TBA

## How to play (screenshots of the gameplay)


   ### A (YouTube) video showing the game running and explaining how it goes.

## Data types (How you applied some concepts from the book in your code, you can reference/use the comments you wrote in your code)
* string: for storing player names (name: String), making it easy to handle text inputs.

* bool: for the is_folded field in the Player struct, which indicates whether a player has folded their hand or not.

* list: Vec (vector) is used throughout the code as a dynamic list to hold multiple items. For example, Vec<Card> is used to store the player's hand, community cards, and deck of cards.

* type equivalence: Action and Option<Action> are examples of type equivalence in Rust. Both represent actions a player can take, but Option<Action> is used to store whether the player has taken an action or not (i.e., itâ€™s None when no action is taken and Some(Action) when a player has chosen an action).
